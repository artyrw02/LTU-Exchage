#### Business Idea
##### **COMMUNITY** `(NETWORK)` **OF (DEVELOPERS / PROGRAMMERS)**

- Web page where people `register` in order to complete challenges regarding the development of **`Mobile applications`** helping them to design their own portfolio for future purpose.

- Each challenge has a category and level of difficulty.

- We don't ask to create a specific application, we just give hits / scenarios.

- This tool will help developers to get to know people and connect with them (like LinkedIn?) while completing the challenges.

- Some challenges will request teams / groups (**`Network for developers`**).

- This community page will allow people to encourage and test themselves as developers and also allow to connect with other people in order to team up and develop their own applications.

- This tools **is not** a ``code repository?????``, emulates the application and people registered will provide reviews and advices / recommendations.

- During the time and level of completition there will be some contests where people of te community will be selected (because of their portfolios as well) in order to apply or work with others for more challenges (also advetise them and their portfolios to companies or projects if they want to).

- Portfolios are creaded by completing challenges and they can be shared / shown to different companies to advertise and help developers.
