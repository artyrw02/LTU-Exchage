##### Products and Services

1. Challenges (application development service):
	**NOT used**- Challenges will be used for people to develop their application and be stored in their portfolio. Each challenge has it's category and level of difficulty. `**Describe more**`.
	---
	Challenges will be used as the starting point for people in order to motivate them to start developing their applications/algorithms which then, can be stored in their projects portfolio.
	
	Each one of these challenges will have a category area and level of difficulty, and can be submitted in several programming languages,`**this is to not limit**` the capabilities of each person with a specified language and `to permit to use a language (or langauges) that can exceed other languages in a specific area,` or has the ability to accomplish each chllange or each part for the challenge in easier ways.
		
2. Community:
	- People will be able to interact via messages, forums or Q&A (either internally or by external services, e.g StackOverlow) with others in order to find support and feedback of their applications/source code.
	
3. Storage portfolio :
	**Not used**- The portfolio will be used to store the source code and applications that they developed through the completion of challeges as well as their own code stored in other services like GitHub in order to share it with the people they want. People will be able to decide whether if they want to share their code or only the exect. 
	--
	**ED modification ** This storage service will act as a Portfolio for people, where the source data will be the applications that they developed through the completion of challeges, stored in form of compiled applications and source code, which can come from their own submitted code, or by external sources stored in other services like GitHub, in order to share it with the people they want. People will be able to decide whether if they want to share their code or only the exect.
	
4. Compilator service:
	- People will be able to upload and use the code stored in their portfolio or external services, and compile it in order to generate their applications, which then can be shown or executed in their portfolio as well, this will allow other people to find and interact with other people's applications.

5. Emulator service:
	- Emulator will be able to run the generated applications stored in the people's portfolio allowing other people to test them, learn about the developers experience and abilities, `**and finally provide to the owner of the application a feedback.**`
	
	**--and finally letting them to give feedback to the developer/owner.**
