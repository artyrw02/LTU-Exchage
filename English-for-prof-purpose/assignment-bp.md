## Business plan - Start

##### Executive plan SECTION 1

##### Company summary  **(COD > Community Of Developers) - (CoOP > Community Of programmers)**??? SECTION 2
	
	`"Name of our business"` is an online community tool that will allow people who like to develop applications/algorithms to go through a series of challeges that will test their developement skills as well as start their own portfolio where they will be able to store all their projects and share them with others.
	
	* Personnel plan or management summary 

		Andrea Rodriguez Tijerina studying a bachelor's degree in computer science at Universidad Regiomontana, in Mexico. She also	did a part-internship at Softtek Mexico, where gained experience in the analysis and support of systems and applications by using different tools (for instance C++, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS) and worked on Unix and Windows environments.	During that time she also took some courses related to web design along with other programming languages tools.
		
		
		For Andrea a true challenge, regarding a profesional purpose, was to start her own business. And because she believes in team work, proactiveness and self-motivation, she came up with the idea of starting **`Name of the company` **, as she recognized the need of a community where people can motivate themselves by going through the completion of challenges that will allow the development of new applications and share them with others in exchange of support and feedback and with the time create their own portfolio of the applications developed and be able to use it for profesional purposes.
		
		
		
				
##### Products and Services SECTION 3

1. Challenges (application development service): <---
	- Challenges will be used as the starting point for the people who wants to be motivated in order to start developing their applications/algorithms which then, can be stored in their projects portfolio.
	- Each one of these challenges will have a category area and level of difficulty, and can be submitted in several programming languages, this is to avoid any kind of limitation regarding the capabilities of each person with a specified programming language and with that, allow them to develop for a specific area or to accomplish each chllange or each part for the challenges in easier ways.  
		
2. Community:
	- Users will be able to interact via messages, forums, or Q&A with others in order to find support and feedback of their applications/source code.
	
3. Storage portfolio:
	- This storage service will act as a Portfolio for the users, where the source data will be stored in form of compiled applications and source code, which can come from the applications that they have developed through the completion of challeges, their own submitted code, or by external sources (code stored in other services like GitHub) in order to share it with the people they want. Users will be able to decide whether if they want to share their code or only the executable application.
	
4. Compilator service:
	- People will be able to upload and use the code stored in their portfolio or external services, and compile it in order to generate their applications, which then can be available and executed, this will allow other people to find and interact with other users applications.

5. Emulator service:
	- Emulator will be able to run the generated applications stored in the users portfolio allowing other people to test them, learn about the developers experience and abilities, and finally the possibility to give feedback to the developer/owner of the applications.
	
##### Market Analysis Summary SECTION 4 TO 7
	SECTION 4 AND 5
	`"Name of our business"` will initialy focus on individual customers, universities, as students are starting to learn about programming, and will like to be motivated and challenged while they learn about the development of different applications.
	
	* Target Market Segment Strategy
		`"Name of our business"` will focus at its majority towards students in universities specificly in the computer science area. The reason for this decision is because students have the enought potential to provide and share new ideas in order to develop new applications by using different programming languages; this will also create a community where users will be able to support each other in order to develop new strategies or tools for other business.
		
		- Market needs and growth (no idea what to write down)
		Innovation is the key word these days as everyday new ideas, tools, and problems are being developed. 
		
	SECTION 7		
	* (Incorrect name)Service Business Analysis
	`"Name of our business"` faces two different competitors that provide a platform that developers can use in order to test their skills and code designed *****
	
		- Competitors
			* Caribbean Online Judge: is a platform for Caribbean universities students used for tranning developement algorithms skills with different programming languages.
			
			 **Check** * CodePen:  is a tool used for testing code fragments that any web or front-end developer will appreciate.

##### Strategy Implementation
	##### Promotion Strategy
	
	Our target client comes mainly from universities, for this reason, we will market and promote our services by using the direct marketing strategy as our **atraer** is to look for students in our network that will be interested in challenge their developing skills and share their work with others along with the word-of-mouth.
